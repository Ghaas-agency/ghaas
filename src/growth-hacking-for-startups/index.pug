          p
            | A young company is classified as a startup if it has the potential to grow exponentially rather than the sustained general 10-20% growth year on year. Paul Graham in his essays goes on to equate startups with growth.
          p
            | Depending on which stage your company is, growth can mean different things for you. We think of growth for startups is reaching the next stage of your company, as fast as possible.
